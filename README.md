A Machine Learning project designed to learn and recognize numbers from pictures and videos.

Welcome!

Things to Research:

Textbook: http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/

Tensorflow Similar Project: https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist.html

If any of you are unfamiliar with Python, you will need to research it. I would suggest Udemy's Complete Python Bootcamp ($11).

Neural Network Libraries

OpenCV

Flask

Python IDEs

Data Set: Possibly http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

I have a pretty good GPU that I am willing to offer depending on how we decide to go about this project.
